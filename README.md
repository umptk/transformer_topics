# Topic Modelling the 20 Newsgroups Dataset


## Introduction

In an effort to develop a sample multilingual topic model applicable to multilingual document sets, we revisit BERTopics, a pipeline that integrates sentence transformers and embeddings to accomplish this task. The easily integrable sentence transformer models introduces the ability to utilize a number of pretrained models capable of vectorizing documents in non-English languages.

For the sake of this exercise, we'll be utilizing the 20 Newsgroups Dataset (said to be available in different languages; otherwise I'll either translate it using `mbart-large` or find something else to use).


The goal is to be able to multilingual topic-cluster all documents in the source language.


## 20 Newsgroups as a Multilingual Dataset

In order to develop hierarchical topic modeling for multilingual documents, we first need a multilingual dataset. In order to achieve this, we can leverage the the Huggingface library's many machine translation models, such as the [mbart-large-50-many-to-many-mmt](https://huggingface.co/facebook/mbart-large-50-many-to-many-mmt).

Running this model in a Python environment requires the `protobuf` package. Make sure this requirement is met by running `pip install protobuf` in the command line.

## Setting up BERTopics and 20 Newsgroups Dataset

Load the dataset from `scikit-learn`'s `fetch_20newsgroups`. We can opt to remove unnecessary data.

```
docs = fetch_20newsgroups(subset='all',  remove=('headers', 'footers', 'quotes'))['data']
docs_samp = random.sample(docs, docs_size) 
```

For the sake of this exercise, we'll be working with a `doc_size` sample of 10000 randomly selected documents. The documents don't repeat. 

This sample size will decrease to 10 documents for the multilingual portion (since my dog poo laptop can't handle more than that).
